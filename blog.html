        <h2>Cryptography: America's Hidden Lifesaver</h2>

            On Tuesday July 20th, we had a speaker come in during class and discuss the topic of cryptography. This discussion was a real eye opener for me because I never realized the impact this field has on society and its safety. Today, cryptography provides us with data privacy and integrity, with certain types of encryption and decryption helping to keep our information from unwanted individuals. For the amount of time I have had electronics and used different apps, I have never had my accounts hacked or my private information leaked, which is partially due to cryptography. It also provides secure services like allowing ATM cash withdrawals to be safe, as well as file storage and web browsing.

            In my opinion, I think that cryptography is positive because it has helped the FBI put away bad men and women, plus it has also allowed for communication to be secure between private parties, like different branches of the military or government sending messages about classified information. They are able to communicate through these encrypted messages without the worry of their enemies intercepting the messages and knowing all of their secrets. Overall, cryptography is an essential part of societyâ€™s information systems today. People have had the luxury of not needing to worry about their privacy as much as other countries due to advancements in technology that can be made and translated into cryptography. This work has been integrated into almost every daily activity and helps everyone to have a greater quality of life, so I for one am fascinated about cryptography and am now a total fan.
