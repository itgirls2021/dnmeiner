        <h2>Cryptography: America's Hidden Lifesaver</h2>
        <p>Dani Meiners / July 21st, 2021</p>
        <p>
            On Tuesday July 20th, we had a speaker come in during class and discuss the topic of cryptography. This discussion was a real eye opener for me because I never realized the impact this field has on society and its safety. Today, cryptography provides us with data privacy and integrity, with certain types of encryption and decryption helping to keep our information from unwanted individuals. For the amount of time I have had electronics and used different apps, I have never had my accounts hacked or my private information leaked, which is partially due to cryptography. It also provides secure services like allowing ATM cash withdrawals to be safe, as well as file storage and web browsing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my opinion, I think that cryptography is positive because it has helped the FBI put away bad men and women, plus it has also allowed for communication to be secure between private parties, like different branches of the military or government sending messages about classified information. They are able to communicate through these encrypted messages without the worry of their enemies intercepting the messages and knowing all of their secrets. Overall, cryptography is an essential part of society’s information systems today. People have had the luxury of not needing to worry about their privacy as much as other countries due to advancements in technology that can be made and translated into cryptography. This work has been integrated into almost every daily activity and helps everyone to have a greater quality of life, so I for one am fascinated about cryptography and am now a total fan.

        <h2>Is Machine Learning A Step In the Right Direction?</h2>
        <p>Dani Meiners / July 23rd, 2021</p>
        <p>
            We just discussed machine learning in class today during the IT Girls course, and it was fascinating. First, we discussed the way that technology has been advancing at a very fast rate, allowing applications like machine learning to thrive. Various groups in the class created different teachable machines that answered specific problems. My group focused on voice recognition, where we each recorded audio samples of our voices, teaching the machine to determine who was speaking when each of us spoke. There were many other ideas shared from the class regarding other ideas, like visual recognition of certain foods, or recognition of certain poses and movements. All of these experiments were very interesting to watch because in a matter of seconds, the machine taught itself the ability to find the pattern, infer, and predict. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This caused me to think of certain applications that carry out these actions in my daily life. The first one I thought of is Youtube. There is an option where you can turn on “Suggested Videos,” which allows the app to begin playing a video that the individual did not choose, but the computer thinks the individual may like. It is using previous data, like earlier videos watched, to look for patterns in interests and play a video that it feels the person would enjoy. This type of machine learning is not only a technological advancement, but it also increases consumer interaction and increases the probability that the consumer will stay on the app because if they are interested in the video, they will stay and watch it. This is very smart because it increases the productivity of the app from not only a technological standpoint, but also from a business standpoint, increasing customer satisfaction and engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though these recommendations or suggestions are interesting and sometimes work, there are many times where they are also incorrect. Computers can sometimes make incorrect assumptions about an individual and machine learning requires massive amounts of data to train on, which means that they are not 100% reliable and could possibly cause the interpretation of results to be incorrect. Certain ways these unfair assumptions could be addressed is that more data could be input into the machine, creating more reliable predictions based on tangible results. Then, test and retest to ensure that the learning systems don’t reflect bias. I believe that machine learning can create so many new opportunities for the future, but you have to take into account the possible drawbacks and incorrect assumptions to be safe.

        <h2>Game Design and the Many Problems it Can Solve</h2>
        <p>Dani Meiners / August 2nd, 2021</p>
        <p>
            On Friday the 30th, a speaker came in during class and discussed women in the field of game designing and we ended up creating concepts for our own games. First of all, I loved this lesson because game design in itself is fascinating, so I already knew that I was going to love the discussion, but the fact that she created an interactive activity made it even more enjoyable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The activity the speaker gave us was to come together in groups and create a game that solved a challenge in a fun way. There were many different directions these instructions could be taken in, but the game challenge that my group decided on was, “How could climate change impact my neighborhood or others?” We felt that this question addressed a very serious topic in the world today, so this game will help society to see the task of reversing or minimizing climate change as less daunting and more of a doable task. The game that inspired our concept was roblox because it is a game where you take on the role of an individual in an online world, interacting with others and completing tasks, which is what we wanted to occur in our game as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of the game was that individuals would understand the effects of climate change after being sent into the world, choosing a place to live in the world, and combating each environmental challenge that comes their way. Climate change is affecting various parts of the land in different ways, so the idea is that each person playing can experience the various situations that climate change can cause. During the game, players will be able to see how their actions affect others and the environment. These outcomes can be both positive and negative, so my group was hopeful that through both positive and negative reinforcement for their actions, players will become more self-aware and end up working towards making the environment a more suitable place to live.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are tasks in the games that players need to complete and they earn points for each task completed, allowing them to customize their home and surroundings. These tasks all positively help the environment (picking up litter/trash, stopping someone from dumping chemicals in the oceans, recycling, using renewable energy sources, etc.), so each one pushes the player towards the ultimate goal, environmental peace and harmony. There are also random natural disasters that can occur from climate change (forest fires, droughts, etc.), so if the player is able to successfully combat these problems and proactively prevent them from occurring in the future, they will be awarded with prizes and their status/job in the game will increase, giving them a larger role in helping the state of the environment. This game helps individuals work towards sustainability while learning how to help preserve the environment in a fun way, accomplishing both teaching and game design, so I love this whole idea and would definitely play this game if it were real.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I loved creating this game and I feel that game design is such a great tool that can be used to create games for kids to learn about the important issues of the world in a way that they can understand, working through each concept at their own pace. I believe that more games like this will broaden many kid’s understanding of current events, helping them to further understand the world we live in and have the knowledge to combat problems that come their way.
