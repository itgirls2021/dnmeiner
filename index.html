        <h1>The Biography of Dani Meiners</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Dani Meiners and I live in Arlington, VA. I will be going into my senior year this fall, graduating in 2022, and I am super excited to get started with IT Girls! I decided to take this class because I have always had an interest in technology so I wanted to expand my horizons and learn as much as I could. I have taken the business courses offered at my high school since freshman year and we have discussed the role that technology plays in starting your own business, marketing, and advertising, but the curriculum never had us dive deeper, so I wanted to do that here.The idea of creating a website is very interesting to me as well as learning about current events regarding technology.

            I play soccer, lacrosse, and volleyball outside of my classes and I love watching Greyâ€™s Anatomy with my friends! I also love to travel with my parents and brother and I am adopting a dog!

            When Dani is not in school, you can find her at the soccer field or the beach, soaking up the sun :)
